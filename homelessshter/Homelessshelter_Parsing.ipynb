                           <p> The INN (Interfaith Nutrition Network) addresses the issues of hunger and homelessness on Long Island by providing food, shelter, long-term housing, and supportive services in a dignified and respectful manner for those who seek our help. We are a not-for-profit, volunteer-based organization with a dedicated staff, a broad base of community support and a commitment to educate the public about these issues.<br /><br />The INN\\'s emergency shelters provide housing and supportive services for guests experiencing the trauma of homelessness. The INN has three emergency shelters in Nassau County two family shelters and one shelter for single men. The INN shelters are open all year long and staffed 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.<br />&nbsp;<br />Each shelter has a social worker to assist guests with crisis intervention and prevention, goal identification and achievement, and overcoming barriers that led to homelessness. The social worker also assists the guests in identifying and developing support systems and services to prevent the future of homelessness. Support staff helps guests to adjust to communal living; ensure a safe, stable, dignified environment; and provide information and referrals.<br />&nbsp;<br />Additional services provided to the shelters include educational workshops for the guests on activities of daily living, parenting, employment, nutrition, etc.<br /><br /><br />Long Term Housing<br />We are the only nonprofit organization on Long Island that has a comprehensive program for homeless families, providing safe, well maintained, affordable housing for 23 families, accompanied by a full range of intensive and supportive services. Homeless families who qualify for the program are offered apartments at a reduced rental rate. These families receive case management services to assist them with self-sufficiency goals. These services include counseling and case management, life skills training, tenancy and home management, educational tutoring for children and parents, and vocational training. The program focuses on the elimination of the causes of homelessness so that families can become independent and successfully graduate from our program.<br /><br />Veterans Housing<br />Catherine Martin INN (CMI) provides communal, transitional housing for homeless male veterans who have completed substance abuse rehabilitation programs and have maintained sobriety for at least nine months.<br />&nbsp;<br />The CMI program focuses on education and skills for future independence. The veterans receive case management services from licensed social workers who assist tenants in achieving goals leading to self-sufficiency. <br />&nbsp;<br />These case management services include crisis intervention and prevention, life-skills training, home management, budgeting and educational/vocational training. Referrals are also given for counseling when needed. The rooms are offered at a reduced rental rate to give the veterans an opportunity to focus on their goals.&nbsp; The INN works closely with the VA in Northport, as well as other veteran agencies, in connecting CMI veterans to the necessary resources.<br />&nbsp;<br />Many of the veterans who have been through CMI have pursued higher education including Bachelor\\xc3\\xa2\\xe2\\x82\\xac\\xe2\\x84\\xa2s Degrees, Associate Degrees and various Vocational Certifications. They secured careers with higher incomes and created significant work histories in the fields of their choice, allowing them to move on from the program and launching independent and self-sufficient lives.<br />&nbsp;<br />During their time at CMI, veterans work with their social worker to find ways to repair relationships that were damaged during their time of substance abuse. The veterans at CMI are provided with a support system that provides them with coping skills to carry them through the future when they have finished the program and are successfully on their own.<br /><br /><br /> \\r\\n                                    \\r\\n                                    \\r\\n                                                                        \\r\\n                                                                            \\r\\n                                                                        \\r\\n                                                                            \\r\\n                                                                            <br /><br />Do you have items to donate?\\r\\n                                        Contact Interfaith Nutrition Network - Mary Brennan INN at the phone number provided above to see if they can use any items you may have to donate.\\t\\r\\n                                                                        <br /><br />\\r\\n    \\r\\n    \\r\\n                                    <b>Shelter Information Last Update Date:</b> 2017-05-22<br />                                            \\r\\n                                    \\r\\n                                    <hr>\\r\\n                                    \\r\\n                                     The below image is a Google Image based on a geocode of the \\'area\\' and is NOT necessarily a picture of the location.

They are clients from the Mainchance Drop In Center, a part of Grand Central Neighborhood Social Services and from Project Reachout, a part of Goddard Riverside Community Center. All shelter guests are screened by one of these two groups.During the day, these organizations provide showers, food, and clothing. They also provide medical and psychiatric care, drug and alcohol rehabilitation programs, and help clients in collecting benefits or money management. After staying at the shelter for a while, a client may move to a subsidized or transitional housing.The role of the shelter is to be a safe place for its guests to wash, eat, relax, and sleep. On any given night, most, if not all, of the guests have stayed at the shelter previously. Many stay for weeks or months at a time. This continuity helps to foster an atmosphere of ease and familiarity, as well as a sense of responsibility toward the shelter and a feeling of community among the guests.The first thing a new volunteer will notice is that the shelter practically runs itself. Or, to be more accurate, the shelter is run by the people it serves. The guests get their own beds, their own food, and they clean up at night and before they leave. Often the volunteer feels like the guest, while the \"guests\" feel right at home. The role of the volunteer is close to that of a good manager: to stand back and let the men do what they are going to do, while intervening, instructing, guiding and troubleshooting only when it becomes necessary.Volunteering is easy. No experience is necessary, and we need your help!The opening shift volunteers (7:00 - 9:00 p.m.) greet the men and unlock the supply cabinet while the overnight volunteers (9:00 p.m. - 6:30 a.m.) lock up in the morning.The volunteers stay undisturbed in a separate room where they can sleep, read, use the phone, or study. We offer volunteer orientation anytime that is convenient for you. Please email us or call the shelter voicemail (212) 865-0600, ext. 212. We&rsquo;ll send you our more detailed Volunteer Guide and answer any questions... (continued)\"\n",

       " \t\t<br/><br/>\n",
       " <b>Day Shelters</b> supplement homeless and low-income people when the shelter their staying in only offers shelter on an overnight basis.  Case management is often provided and sometimes there are laundry and  shower facilities.  Meals and basic hygiene may also be offered.   Almost all day shelters provide their services free of charge. Any  emergency or homeless shelter that allows clients to stay during the  day is also classified under this category.\n",
       "                     <br/><br/>\n",
       " <b>Emergency  Homeless Shelters</b> both provide short term relief for the homeless &amp; low-income. Usually there is  a maximum stay of 3 months or less. Many of these shelters ask their  clients to leave during the day.  Meals and other supportive services  are often offered.  3 times out of 5 these shelters offer their  services free of charge.\n",
       " \t\t<br/><br/>\n",
       " <b>Halfway Housing</b> helps transition individuals and families from shelters or homelessness  to permanent housing. Length of stay is usually anywhere from 6 months  to 2 years.  Residents are often required to pay at least 30% of their  income toward program fees.  Sometimes the money they pay in fees is  returned to them when they leave. Any emergency or homeless shelter  that allows their clients to stay more then 6 months is also classified  under this category. \n",
       "                  <br/><br/>\n",
       " <b>Permanent Affordable Housing</b> is a long-term solution for housing. Residents are often allowed to stay as long as they remain in the low-income bracket but is sometimes  limited 3 - 5 years.  Residents pay no more than 30% of their income  toward rent. Emergency shelters, homeless shelters and transitional  housing programs that allow their clients to stay without a maximum  stay is also classified under this category. \n",
       "                  <br/><br/>\n",
       " <b>Drug And Alcohol Rehab</b> programs are intended to treat alcohol and/or drug dependency.  The cost of  participating in one of these programs and the method of treatment  range significantly. The database operated on this website only  includes residential rehab programs (not outpatient programs). We also provide Access to Recovery (ATR) Grant programs for substance abuse treatment. </div></div></div></body></html>,\n",

They are clients from the Mainchance Drop In Center, a part of Grand Central Neighborhood Social Services and from Project Reachout, a part of Goddard Riverside Community Center. All shelter guests are screened by one of these two groups.During the day, these organizations provide showers, food, and clothing. They also provide medical and psychiatric care, drug and alcohol rehabilitation programs, and help clients in collecting benefits or money management. After staying at the shelter for a while, a client may move to a subsidized or transitional housing.The role of the shelter is to be a safe place for its guests to wash, eat, relax, and sleep. On any given night, most, if not all, of the guests have stayed at the shelter previously. Many stay for weeks or months at a time. This continuity helps to foster an atmosphere of ease and familiarity, as well as a sense of responsibility toward the shelter and a feeling of community among the guests.The first thing a new volunteer will notice is that the shelter practically runs itself. Or, to be more accurate, the shelter is run by the people it serves. The guests get their own beds, their own food, and they clean up at night and before they leave. Often the volunteer feels like the guest, while the \"guests\" feel right at home. The role of the volunteer is close to that of a good manager: to stand back and let the men do what they are going to do, while intervening, instructing, guiding and troubleshooting only when it becomes necessary.Volunteering is easy. No experience is necessary, and we need your help!The opening shift volunteers (7:00 - 9:00 p.m.) greet the men and unlock the supply cabinet while the overnight volunteers (9:00 p.m. - 6:30 a.m.) lock up in the morning.The volunteers stay undisturbed in a separate room where they can sleep, read, use the phone, or study. We offer volunteer orientation anytime that is convenient for you. Please email us or call the shelter voicemail (212) 865-0600, ext. 212. We&rsquo;ll send you our more detailed Volunteer Guide and answer any questions... (continued)\"\n",

       " <br/>\n",
       "                   We provide many categories of shelter for those in need and in need of services. They include: \n",
       " \t\t<br/><br/>\n",
       " <b>Day Shelters</b> supplement homeless and low-income people when the shelter their staying in only offers shelter on an overnight basis.  Case management is often provided and sometimes there are laundry and  shower facilities.  Meals and basic hygiene may also be offered.   Almost all day shelters provide their services free of charge. Any  emergency or homeless shelter that allows clients to stay during the  day is also classified under this category.\n",
       "                     <br/><br/>\n",
       " <b>Emergency  Homeless Shelters</b> both provide short term relief for the homeless &amp; low-income. Usually there is  a maximum stay of 3 months or less. Many of these shelters ask their  clients to leave during the day.  Meals and other supportive services  are often offered.  3 times out of 5 these shelters offer their  services free of charge.\n",
       " \t\t<br/><br/>\n",
       " <b>Halfway Housing</b> helps transition individuals and families from shelters or homelessness  to permanent housing. Length of stay is usually anywhere from 6 months  to 2 years.  Residents are often required to pay at least 30% of their  income toward program fees.  Sometimes the money they pay in fees is  returned to them when they leave. Any emergency or homeless shelter  that allows their clients to stay more then 6 months is also classified  under this category. \n",
       "                  <br/><br/>\n",
       " <b>Permanent Affordable Housing</b> is a long-term solution for housing. Residents are often allowed to stay as long as they remain in the low-income bracket but is sometimes  limited 3 - 5 years.  Residents pay no more than 30% of their income  toward rent. Emergency shelters, homeless shelters and transitional  housing programs that allow their clients to stay without a maximum  stay is also classified under this category. \n",
       "                  <br/><br/>\n",
       " <b>Drug And Alcohol Rehab</b> programs are intended to treat alcohol and/or drug dependency.  The cost of  participating in one of these programs and the method of treatment  range significantly. The database operated on this website only  includes residential rehab programs (not outpatient programs). We also provide Access to Recovery (ATR) Grant programs for substance abuse treatment. </div></div></div></body>]"

They are clients from the Mainchance Drop In Center, a part of Grand Central Neighborhood Social Services and from Project Reachout, a part of Goddard Riverside Community Center. All shelter guests are screened by one of these two groups.During the day, these organizations provide showers, food, and clothing. They also provide medical and psychiatric care, drug and alcohol rehabilitation programs, and help clients in collecting benefits or money management. After staying at the shelter for a while, a client may move to a subsidized or transitional housing.The role of the shelter is to be a safe place for its guests to wash, eat, relax, and sleep. On any given night, most, if not all, of the guests have stayed at the shelter previously. Many stay for weeks or months at a time. This continuity helps to foster an atmosphere of ease and familiarity, as well as a sense of responsibility toward the shelter and a feeling of community among the guests.The first thing a new volunteer will notice is that the shelter practically runs itself. Or, to be more accurate, the shelter is run by the people it serves. The guests get their own beds, their own food, and they clean up at night and before they leave. Often the volunteer feels like the guest, while the \"guests\" feel right at home. The role of the volunteer is close to that of a good manager: to stand back and let the men do what they are going to do, while intervening, instructing, guiding and troubleshooting only when it becomes necessary.Volunteering is easy. No experience is necessary, and we need your help!The opening shift volunteers (7:00 - 9:00 p.m.) greet the men and unlock the supply cabinet while the overnight volunteers (9:00 p.m. - 6:30 a.m.) lock up in the morning.The volunteers stay undisturbed in a separate room where they can sleep, read, use the phone, or study. We offer volunteer orientation anytime that is convenient for you. Please email us or call the shelter voicemail (212) 865-0600, ext. 212. We&rsquo;ll send you our more detailed Volunteer Guide and answer any questions... (continued)\"\n",

       "                   We provide many categories of shelter for those in need and in need of services. They include: \n",
       " \t\t<br/><br/>\n",
       " <b>Day Shelters</b> supplement homeless and low-income people when the shelter their staying in only offers shelter on an overnight basis.  Case management is often provided and sometimes there are laundry and  shower facilities.  Meals and basic hygiene may also be offered.   Almost all day shelters provide their services free of charge. Any  emergency or homeless shelter that allows clients to stay during the  day is also classified under this category.\n",
       "                     <br/><br/>\n",
       " <b>Emergency  Homeless Shelters</b> both provide short term relief for the homeless &amp; low-income. Usually there is  a maximum stay of 3 months or less. Many of these shelters ask their  clients to leave during the day.  Meals and other supportive services  are often offered.  3 times out of 5 these shelters offer their  services free of charge.\n",
       " \t\t<br/><br/>\n",
       " <b>Halfway Housing</b> helps transition individuals and families from shelters or homelessness  to permanent housing. Length of stay is usually anywhere from 6 months  to 2 years.  Residents are often required to pay at least 30% of their  income toward program fees.  Sometimes the money they pay in fees is  returned to them when they leave. Any emergency or homeless shelter  that allows their clients to stay more then 6 months is also classified  under this category. \n",
       "                  <br/><br/>\n",
       " <b>Permanent Affordable Housing</b> is a long-term solution for housing. Residents are often allowed to stay as long as they remain in the low-income bracket but is sometimes  limited 3 - 5 years.  Residents pay no more than 30% of their income  toward rent. Emergency shelters, homeless shelters and transitional  housing programs that allow their clients to stay without a maximum  stay is also classified under this category. \n",
       "                  <br/><br/>\n",
       " <b>Drug And Alcohol Rehab</b> programs are intended to treat alcohol and/or drug dependency.  The cost of  participating in one of these programs and the method of treatment  range significantly. The database operated on this website only  includes residential rehab programs (not outpatient programs). We also provide Access to Recovery (ATR) Grant programs for substance abuse treatment. </div></div></div>]"

They are clients from the Mainchance Drop In Center, a part of Grand Central Neighborhood Social Services and from Project Reachout, a part of Goddard Riverside Community Center. All shelter guests are screened by one of these two groups.During the day, these organizations provide showers, food, and clothing. They also provide medical and psychiatric care, drug and alcohol rehabilitation programs, and help clients in collecting benefits or money management. After staying at the shelter for a while, a client may move to a subsidized or transitional housing.The role of the shelter is to be a safe place for its guests to wash, eat, relax, and sleep. On any given night, most, if not all, of the guests have stayed at the shelter previously. Many stay for weeks or months at a time. This continuity helps to foster an atmosphere of ease and familiarity, as well as a sense of responsibility toward the shelter and a feeling of community among the guests.The first thing a new volunteer will notice is that the shelter practically runs itself. Or, to be more accurate, the shelter is run by the people it serves. The guests get their own beds, their own food, and they clean up at night and before they leave. Often the volunteer feels like the guest, while the \"guests\" feel right at home. The role of the volunteer is close to that of a good manager: to stand back and let the men do what they are going to do, while intervening, instructing, guiding and troubleshooting only when it becomes necessary.Volunteering is easy. No experience is necessary, and we need your help!The opening shift volunteers (7:00 - 9:00 p.m.) greet the men and unlock the supply cabinet while the overnight volunteers (9:00 p.m. - 6:30 a.m.) lock up in the morning.The volunteers stay undisturbed in a separate room where they can sleep, read, use the phone, or study. We offer volunteer orientation anytime that is convenient for you. Please email us or call the shelter voicemail (212) 865-0600, ext. 212. We&rsquo;ll send you our more detailed Volunteer Guide and answer any questions... (continued)\"\n",

Our mission is to provide low and moderate-income and homeless older adults on Manhattan's West Side with the basic support and services they need to enrich their lives and live independently in the community for as long as possible. For homeless elders, Project FIND offers case management and counseling, assistance in obtaining entitlements and benefits, help getting to the doctor and obtaining medications, and more. At our Woodstock Senior Center, seniors can get hot showers and clean clothes. Our social workers try to put homeless seniors on a path toward finding housing.

This unique organization has helped over 20,000 people find food, shelter, counseling, employment, and in many cases, housing. The people served face multiple barriers to leading stable, productive lives: inadequate education, limited employment skills, histories of mental illness and substance abuse, and sometimes a history of incarceration.

       "<br/>\n",
       "                  We provide many categories of shelter for those in need and in need of services. They include: \n",
       "\t\t<br/><br/>\n",
       "<b>Day Shelters</b> supplement homeless and low-income people when the shelter their staying in only offers shelter on an overnight basis.  Case management is often provided and sometimes there are laundry and  shower facilities.  Meals and basic hygiene may also be offered.   Almost all day shelters provide their services free of charge. Any  emergency or homeless shelter that allows clients to stay during the  day is also classified under this category.\n",
       "                    <br/><br/>\n",
       "<b>Emergency  Homeless Shelters</b> both provide short term relief for the homeless &amp; low-income. Usually there is  a maximum stay of 3 months or less. Many of these shelters ask their  clients to leave during the day.  Meals and other supportive services  are often offered.  3 times out of 5 these shelters offer their  services free of charge.\n",
       "\t\t<br/><br/>\n",
       "<b>Halfway Housing</b> helps transition individuals and families from shelters or homelessness  to permanent housing. Length of stay is usually anywhere from 6 months  to 2 years.  Residents are often required to pay at least 30% of their  income toward program fees.  Sometimes the money they pay in fees is  returned to them when they leave. Any emergency or homeless shelter  that allows their clients to stay more then 6 months is also classified  under this category. \n",
       "                 <br/><br/>\n",
       "<b>Permanent Affordable Housing</b> is a long-term solution for housing. Residents are often allowed to stay as long as they remain in the low-income bracket but is sometimes  limited 3 - 5 years.  Residents pay no more than 30% of their income  toward rent. Emergency shelters, homeless shelters and transitional  housing programs that allow their clients to stay without a maximum  stay is also classified under this category. \n",
       "                 <br/><br/>\n",
       "<b>Drug And Alcohol Rehab</b> programs are intended to treat alcohol and/or drug dependency.  The cost of  participating in one of these programs and the method of treatment  range significantly. The database operated on this website only  includes residential rehab programs (not outpatient programs). We also provide Access to Recovery (ATR) Grant programs for substance abuse treatment. </div></div></div></body></html>\n",
       "<br/><br/>\n",
       "<b>Supportive Housing</b> Programs that provide an alternative living arrangement for individuals who, because of age, disability, substance abuse, mental illness, chronic homelessness or other circumstances, are unable to live independently without care, supervision and/or support to help them in the activities of daily living; or who need access to case management, housing support, vocational, employment and other services to transition to independent living. \n",
       "\t\t<br/>\n",
       "<br/>\n",
       "<b>Shared Housing</b> Programs helps bring low income persons together and helps prevent homelessness by providing affordable housing options. This service is good for families, disabled persons, and others wanted more companionship. ShelterListings.org finds these shared housing locations and lists them throughout our website. \n",
       "\t\t<br/><br/>\n",
       "<b>Rooming House or Boarding House</b> A rooming house is a building in which renters occupy single rooms and share kitchens, bathrooms, and common areas. \n",
       "\t\t\tThe location may be a converted single family home, a converted hotel, or a purpose built structure. Rooming houses are low cost housing and may have as few as three rooms for rent, or more than a hundred. The same goes for boarding houses. We list these types of residences throughout ShelterListings.org. \n",
       "\t\t<br/><br/>\n",
       "<b>Transitional housing</b> is affordable low cost supportive housing designed to provide housing and appropriate support services to persons who are homeless \n",
       "or who are close to homelessness. The transition is to help them be more self sufficient to move toward independent living on their own. \n",
       "Services provided at transitional housing facilities varies from substance abuse treatment, to psychological assistanc, job \n",
       "training, domestic violence assistance, etc. The assistance provided varies, but it is generally affordable and low cost housing. Read the descriptions of each \n",
